# Deck

Deck is an api/score server, designed for older osu! clients from 2008 to 2013.

Please view [this repository](https://github.com/osuTitanic/titanic) for setup instructions!

Everything has been completed, aside from score submission in modern osu! stable clients. You can view the todo's for it [here](https://github.com/users/osuTitanic/projects/2).
